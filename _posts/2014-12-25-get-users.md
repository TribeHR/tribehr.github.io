The following requests can be made to read users from TribeHR. (Support for create, update, and delete operations is in the works.)

The Users endpoint introduces the concept of comprehension between objects in TribeHR. Objects that are comprehended within another belong exclusively to that object.
This is the case for Employee Records and Assignment Records - these objects only have meaning when associated with a User and not on their own.
Because these objects are comprehended within Users, TribeHR's API outputs full representations of these objects when a full representation of a User object is requested.

## List active users

Includes all the active users in TribeHR (not terminated).

Users are output in the order in which they were created in TribeHR.
