# Introduction

Welcome to TribeHR's API documentation. We provide a RESTful API in order for 3rd party integrations or 
apps to request or deliver data to the TribeHR web app. We are pleased to announce the availability of 
version 2.0 of our API, which is documented here. For information about our old API, which is currently 
still available, please refer to [developers.tribehr.com/api](http://developers.tribehr.com/api).

Please be aware that this is not yet a fully released product and as such we are not able to provide full 
support yet. If you run into issues, however, feel free to contact [support@tribehr.com](mailto:support@tribehr.com), 
and we will do our best to help, although it may take a little longer than normal.

We welcome feedback on our API as well as this documentation - please feel free to comment on these pages
or get in contact with us at [support@tribehr.com](mailto:support@tribehr.com)

## Versioning
The TribeHR API uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/), which, in short, means that we use a
three-part version string to specify the API version, such as `2.0.1`. *All changes* to the API generate
*some* change in the version number. Breaking changes increment the *major* version (`2.0.1 ==> 3.0.0`);
non-breaking, functional changes result in an increment of the *minor* version (`2.0.1 ==> 2.1.0`); and
bug fixes adjust the *patch* version (`2.0.1 ==> 2.0.2`).

We will be deprecating and eventually removing support for old API versions, but for now API v1 is still
supported. Any deprecation/removal of support will be posted to our 
[developer website](http://developers.tribehr.com) so that you can react to any planned changes.
